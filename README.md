# Football Data Intelligence Lab

**Football Data Intelligence Lab** is a project focused on applying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence to football technologies and analytics.

The repository is structured as a small "lab" containing three main modules:

1. **Player Performance Prediction**  
   Predict whether a player will deliver a "good" performance in an upcoming match, using per-90 statistics, historical form, and contextual match features.

2. **Match Outcome Prediction**  
   Predict match results (Win/Draw/Loss) based on team-level statistics, rolling averages, and recent form indicators.

3. **Player Similarity & Scouting Assistant**  
   Find players similar to a given reference player using feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, similarity metrics, and visualizations.

Each module is designed to be:
- **Modular** (self-contained subproject)
- **Reproducible** (clear data and code structure)
- **Explainable** (notebooks, reports, and documentation)
